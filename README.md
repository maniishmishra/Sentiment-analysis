# Sentiment-analysis
This project is a Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project built with Python that classifies tweets into positive, negative  sentiments. By leveraging  machine learning, the project demonstrates how unstructured text data from social media can be transformed into actionable insights


🔍 Project Overview

Social media platforms like Twitter are rich sources of public opinion. Businesses, researchers, and policymakers can gain valuable insights from analyzing sentiments expressed in tweets. This project collects tweets, preprocesses the text, and applies sentiment analysis models to determine the overall emotional tone.

The analysis pipeline includes:

Data Collection – Tweets are extracted using the Tweepy API or loaded from a pre-existing dataset (CSV/JSON).

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning text by removing stop words, URLs, special characters, punctuation, and converting to lowercase. Tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization are applied for better representation.

Model Training & Prediction – Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) are trained to classify sentiments. Deep learning methods (LSTMs, transformers) can also be explored.

Evaluation – The model’s performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
